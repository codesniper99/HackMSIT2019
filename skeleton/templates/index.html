            <h4>
                <br>Welcome to Entrepre-Neural
            </h4>

        </div>

        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
               <p> As we all know, businesses today work with huge amounts of
                data. Even startups in their birth stages have to deal with a
                lot of user generated information. And where there is Big
                Data , Machine Learnin g (ML) can play an important role.
                ML and data mining can help businesses predict customer
                behaviours, purchasing patterns, and help in sending best
                possible offers to individual customers, based on their
                browsing and purchase histories.
                The one thing that companies need to access this plethora of
                knowledge are data scientists . But what if we can remove
                this factor?</p><br>
                <p>Our idea is to generate a platform for entrepreneurs and
                        individuals lacking the knowledge of ML to be able to use the
                        popular tools of Machine Learning such as Regression,
                        Classification, Cluster Analysis etc. without having to resort to
                        someone with the knowledge of these topics.
                        Imagine a Website and Android App where you can upload
                        your data (in the form of CSV files) and choose your wanted
                        Prediction tools. Decide what features you want to give
                        priority to, and get results instantly based upon your data.
                        That is what we have to offer.</p>
